This is a set of about 145ish Argentine towns and cities' names, made mostly because the other Argentine townnames were all mostly random places I'd never heard about.

In exchange for a smaller townname list, this townname pack brings you better known townnames.

NOTE: Due to the limited amount of townnames, it's recomended you play with fewer towns in smaller maps for a better experience.
